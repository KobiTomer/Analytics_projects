# Revealing the data with Tableau and SQL
I have presented a few Tableau Dashboards using public datasets below. You can find each Tableau Dashboard within the "Projects" Folder in this repository. Feel free to check out images of the dashboards below, and download any project that interests you. I also included SQL query code files to arrange the data into the correct representation, clean the data, and show different SQL skills.

#### ILBuildingNumbers

- Project Name: Israel construction
- Dataset: [ILBuildingNumbers](https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/Statistics/Pages/%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D.aspx)

This project consists of several sources of the same data for construction starts, construction ends, and population growth numbers. I combined them and manipulated the data with SQL, in order to find an answer to the supply and demand of housing question. The result is not surprising, but the knowledge is important.

#### IMDb TV Series Data

- Project Name: Action Movies
- Dataset: [IMDb TV Series Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/imdb-tv-series-data)

This dataset logs the movies and series of the action genre, with a bit more information like run time, rating, votes, and revenue. The visualization above shows how the audience clearly determines the revenue with a basic principle - please the audience, get more votes and earn more revenue.

#### Smoking Bans

-	Project Name: Smoking Bans
- Dataset: [Do Workplace Smoking Bans Reduce Smoking?](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshx27/do-workplace-smoking-bans-reduce-smoking)

This dataset contained basic personal information such as age and race, education level, and smoking status before and after a ban. I used the data to construct a very simple dashboard showing us clearly the answers to the most important questions we can think of when encountering that kind of information. Does the ban help to rehab smokers? Does education help? And what about race differences?
Take a look and find out.  


#### Sleeping Alone
![SleepingAlone](https://github.com/KobiTomer/Analytics_projects/blob/main/Projects/Married%20couples%20sleep%20apart/Married%20couples%20sleep%20apart.png)

- Project Name: Married couples sleep apart
- Dataset: [Do Workplace Smoking Bans Reduce Smoking?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-how-many-couples-sleep-in-separate-beds/)

In this dataset, we can find a lot of very detailed personal information from a survey about relationships, sleeping habits, and the reasons why they choose to sleep apart. I used this one too with a very simple dashboard to answer the basic question, with a twist from the original article, using data about married couples only.
